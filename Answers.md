1. The relationship between the "product" and "product_category" entities is likely a many-to-one relationship, where each product belongs to one product category. Still, a product category can have multiple products associated with it. This is indicated by the "category id" attribute in the "product" table, which likely serves as a foreign key referencing the "id" attribute in the "product_category" table.
2. To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, we can set up a foreign key constraint between the "category id" column in the "Product" table and the "id" column in the "product_category" table. It ensures that any value entered in the "category id" column of the "product" table must exist in the "id" column of the "product_category" table.
